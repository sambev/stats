Stats server

My frist attempt at a RESTful API in Flask with Storm.  
Getting this to work will take a couple steps:

1: Dependencies - Install them with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2: Database - You can use whatever you would like. I used MySQL-python
3: A better salt and secret key

Once you have 1 and 2 you should be able to run it with
`python server.py`

Resources:

/programs
    GET: list all programs
    POST: create a program

(I should probably change this one to avoid confusion with the next URL)
/stats/<string:program_name>
    GET: return all stats for the given program

/stats/<int:stat_id>
    GET: get the data for the given stat
    POST: create a new stat for the particular program
    PUT: update a particular stat
    DELETE: delete a particular stat XXX Not implimented yet
